## Overview

This project aims to predict the severity of road accidents using machine learning algorithms. Accurate prediction of accident severity can help in implementing targeted safety measures and improving emergency response systems to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is [provide_dataset_name_here]. It contains detailed information about road accidents, including factors such as weather conditions, road type, time of day, and severity of the accident.

## Methodology

We employed a variety of machine learning models, including but not limited to:

- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

We evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model was selected for deployment.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:
